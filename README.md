### Next.js React.js TypeScript TailwindCSS

I used CNA(Create Next App)

#### Why did I use them?

- **Next.js (version 13)**
  - Next. js is a great choice if you are building a static site or an application that doesn't require complex routing, as it automates many of the build processes and offers built-in support for server-side rendering
- **React.js (latest varsion 18.2)**
  - React basically allows developers to utilize individual parts of their application on both the client-side and the server-side, which ultimately boosts the speed of the development process.
- **TypeScript (version ^5)**
  - TypeScript's primary purpose is to improve productivity when developing complex applications. One way this happens is to enable IDEs to have a richer environment to spot common errors while you type the code. This adds a type of safety to your projects.
- **Tailwind (version ^3.3)**
  - Tailwind CSS is best used to speed up the development process by writing less code. It comes with a design system that helps maintain consistency across various design requirements like padding, spacing, and so forth; with this, you do not have to worry about creating your design systems.
- **HeadLess UI (version latest)**
  - Completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS.

TailWind config and global.css file was taken from [JSMastery Crush course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNSHPyVryU). Other parts were writen by hands ^-^
